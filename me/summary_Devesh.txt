My name is Devesh Sonpure. I'm a Technical product Owner, Project and Program Manager in Virtusa consulting services. I'm originally from India, but I moved to Tampa Florida in 2022.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, whenever in doubt "Chicken Biryani" is not go to dish almost in any occasion.
